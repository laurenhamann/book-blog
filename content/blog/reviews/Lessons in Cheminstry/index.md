## Book Description

Chemist Elizabeth Zott is not your average woman. Elizabeth Zott would be the first to point out that there is no such thing as an average woman. But it’s the early 1960s and her all-male team at Hastings Research Institute takes a very unscientific view of equality. Except for one: Calvin Evans; the lonely, brilliant, Nobel–prize-nominated grudge-holder who falls in love with—of all things—her mind. True chemistry results.

But like science, life is unpredictable. This is why a few years later Elizabeth Zott finds herself not only a single mother but the reluctant star of America’s most beloved cooking show Supper at Six. Elizabeth’s unusual approach to cooking (“combine one tablespoon acetic acid with a pinch of sodium chloride”) proves revolutionary. But as her following grows, not everyone is happy. Because as it turns out, Elizabeth Zott isn’t just teaching women to cook. She’s daring them to change the status quo.

## My Thoughts

I went into this book fully expecting a romance book. Definitely not. Now there is a bit of romance but more than that, Elizabeth is a woman dealing with the misogynism of almost every man she meets. She is a self-assured woman who finds herself raising a child alone and doing what she needs to do to make money for her family. But she won't degrade herself for what men think women want. I loved this book.
