A heart surgeon at the top of his field, Stephen Aston is getting married again. But first, he must divorce his current wife, even though she can no longer speak for herself.

With their mother in a precarious position, Tully and Rachel is determined to get to the truth about their family’s secrets, the new wife closing in, and who their father is.

THE YOUNGER WIFE
Heather has secrets of her own. Will getting to the truth unleash the most dangerous impulses in all of them?
