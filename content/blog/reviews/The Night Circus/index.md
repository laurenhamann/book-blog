## Book Description

The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night.

But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.

True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus performers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead.

Written in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart.

## My Thoughts

Okay. I just finished this one. It was a bit of a struggle because I had to make sure I was fully focused the entire time. There was so much filler in this book that I found it hard to completely lose myself in the story. Before starting this one, I read a few of the reviews on goodreads. Someone said that this book was like a wedding cake, looks beautiful with all the little details made precisely with fondant but when you finally bite into it there isn't much cake.
Now I can admit that possibly, I was swayed by reading this review before listening but I found that review to be 100% accurate.
The story is very unique. That is why I gave it 4 stars. But the story was so large that it became extremely vague. I also believe that this vast story made the characters feel less real in a way. I couldn't feel for them as I normally do in such dramatic ups and downs.
