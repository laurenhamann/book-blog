## Book Description

The Vignes twin sisters will always be identical. But after growing up together in a small, southern black community and running away at age sixteen, it's not just the shape of their daily lives that is different as adults, it's everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities. Many years later, one sister lives with her black daughter in the same southern town she once tried to escape. The other passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past. Still, even separated by so many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain intertwined. What will happen to the next generation, when their own daughters' storylines intersect?

Weaving together multiple strands and generations of this family, from the Deep South to California, from the 1950s to the 1990s, Brit Bennett produces a story that is at once a riveting, emotional family story and a brilliant exploration of the American history of passing. Looking well beyond issues of race, The Vanishing Half considers the lasting influence of the past as it shapes a person's decisions, desires, and expectations, and explores some of the multiple reasons and realms in which people sometimes feel pulled to live as something other than their origins.

## My Thoughts

This is the book I wanted when I read [Pachinko]('./pachinko). I love the time jumps and I hate the time jumps. I felt jolted after the first time jump. But I got used to it. The author did a great job of filling in details that might be brushed over when the time jumps 5 or 10 years. The story was depressing. These stories always are because you can see the effects of a damaged parent on their child. Maybe because I am a parent but I find this very difficult to read. (probably because of my fears).

This book follows a family split in two. Twin sisters that ran away from home. Then split from each other. A family that has so much embedded trauma that translates to their kids years later.

My sister gifted me this book over 3 years ago. Moral of the story -- If my sister recommends a book, read it!
