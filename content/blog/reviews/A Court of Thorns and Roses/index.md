## Book Description

When nineteen-year-old huntress Feyre kills a wolf in the woods, a terrifying creature arrives to demand retribution. Dragged to a treacherous magical land she knows about only from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not truly a beast, but one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled her world.

At least, he’s not a beast all the time.

As she adapts to her new home, her feelings for the faerie, Tamlin, transform from icy hostility into a fiery passion that burns through every lie she’s been told about the beautiful, dangerous world of the Fae. But something is not right in the faerie lands. An ancient, wicked shadow is growing, and Feyre must find a way to stop it or doom Tamlin—and his world—forever.

## My Thoughts

I got this book on Audible back in December of 2021. I wasn't interested in the Fantasy genre at the time. My sister recommended that we both read it after she had finished Crescent City Book one. Needless to say, we both forgot about it and never read it.
This February I found myself in a position I am almost never in. The library app I use, Libby, was empty. All the books I wanted to listen to were on extremely long holds.
I scrolled through my audible and found ACOTAR. I started the book and got to cleaning.
I tend to do something super mindless when I am starting a new book so I can focus on understanding the story. After about an hour I was very intrigued.

Right around the time that Tamlin came through the door to either kill or kidnap Feyre. Fast forward two weeks and I have finished all 4.5 books.
To say that this series consumed my days would be an understatement.
This is a great intro with three distinct sections of the book.
The first I would title, "Fight or Flight".
The second section, "Flimsy Whimsy".
The third section, "Dark Shortcomings".
