## Book Description

Belly measures her life in summers. Everything good, everything magical happens between the months of June and August. Winters are simply a time to count the weeks until the next summer, a place away from the beach house, away from Susannah, and most importantly, away from Jeremiah and Conrad. They are the boys that Belly has known since her very first summerâ€”they have been her brother figures, her crushes, and everything in between. But one summer, one terrible and wonderful summer, the more everything changes, the more it all ends up just the way it should have been all along.

## My thoughts
This book is a great first in the series. It drives into the characters. I loved Susanna. Jenny was a bit annoying, but she is also a teenage girl. She is a teenage girl that is lovesick over a boy she has known her entire life that doesn't see her as anything more than a pest. He is a jerk. But some subtle qualities resemble a nice guy. Maybe. I said this was a great first in the series. After finishing the trilogy I have a soft spot for this book. But if this was a stand-alone novel, it would seem aimless.
