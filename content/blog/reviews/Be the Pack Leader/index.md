## Book Description

Filled with practical tips and techniques as well as real-life success stories from his clients (including the Grogan family, owners of Marley from "Marley & Me") and his popular television show "Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan, " Cesar helps you understand and read your dog's energy as well as your own so that you can move beyond just correcting behavioral issues and take your connection with your dog to the next level.
The principles of calm-assertive energy will help you become a better pack leader in every area of your life, improving your relationships with friends, family, and coworkers.
In addition, Cesar addresses several important issues for the first time, including what you need to know about the major dog behavior tools available and the difference between "personality" and "instability."
