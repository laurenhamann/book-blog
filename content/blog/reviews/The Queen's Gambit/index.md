## Book Description

When she is sent to an orphanage at the age of eight, Beth Harmon soon discovers two ways to escape her surroundings, albeit fleetingly: playing chess and taking the little green pills given to her and the other children to keep them subdued. Before long, it becomes apparent that hers is a prodigious talent, and as she progresses to the top of the US chess rankings she is able to forge a new life for herself. But she can never quite overcome her urge to self-destruct. For Beth, thereâ€™s more at stake than merely winning and losing.

## My Thoughts

This book has been on my shelf for ages. Before reading this book, I hadn't seen the Netflix series. After reading this, I did watch it. I loved it as much as the book. The book was a surprise to me. I found the series a great companion to the book. Now I don't know anything about chess. I have never played, but I still really enjoyed how beautifully the games were written. I understand why this book is a classic. I think I will listen again.
