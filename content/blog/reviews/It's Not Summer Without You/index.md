## Book Description

Belly finds out what comes after falling in love in this follow-up to The Summer I Turned Pretty from the New York Times bestselling author of To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before (soon to be a major motion picture!), Jenny Han.

Can summer be truly summer without Cousins Beach?

It used to be that Belly counted the days until summer until she was back at Cousins Beach with Conrad and Jeremiah. But not this year. Not after Susannah got sick again and Conrad stopped caring. Everything right and good have fallen apart, leaving Belly wishing summer would never come.

But when Jeremiah calls saying Conrad has disappeared, Belly knows what she must do to make things right again. And it can only happen back at the beach house, the three of them together, the way things used to be. If this summer really and truly is the last, it should end the way it started—at Cousins Beach.

## Quotes

<blockquote>
That's when I finally got it. I finally understood. It wasn't the thought that counted. It was the actual execution that mattered, the showing up for somebody. The intent behind it wasn't enough. Not for me. Not anymore. It wasn't enough to know that deep down, he loved me. You had to say it to somebody, show them you cared. And he just didn't. Not enough. - Jenny

## My Thoughts

Okay, so I finished this in one sitting. Straight through. I have read a couple of trilogies, this followed a typical second book in the series. This is the sad one. The heartbreak one. The slow one. But I still liked it a lot. Jenny was growing up. She is at the, 'not a girl, not yet a woman', stage.
The book starts in despair, there is a feeling of mourning throughout this book.
