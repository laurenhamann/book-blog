## Book Description

After a tragic fire in 1922 that killed 19-year-old chambermaid, Grace Hadley, The Hotel Nantucket descended from a gilded age gem to a mediocre budget-friendly lodge to inevitably an abandoned eyesore — until it's purchased and renovated top to bottom by London billionaire, Xavier Darling.  Xavier hires Nantucket sweetheart Lizbet Keaton as his general manager, and Lizbet, in turn, pulls together a charismatic, if inexperienced, staff who share the vision of turning the fate of the hotel around. They face challenges in getting along with one another (and with the guests), overcoming the hotel's bad reputation, and surviving the (mostly) harmless shenanigans of Grace Hadley herself — who won't stop haunting the hotel until her murder is acknowledged.




## My thoughts

As always, I listened to this book. I found the narrator to be okay. I have heard her before. Her name is Erin Bennett. She did the other two Elin books I had listened to. Out of the three books, I have listened to this was the hardest to get into. I found the ghost storyline to be unimportant to the actual storyline. The ghost storyline almost seemed like the author didn't have a conclusive ending and was added in the edit. Other than the strange ghost storyline, the rest was typical. It was okay. <br />
There was a character that kept saying he felt horrible about something. It was ominous. But the reveal was uneventful. Not my favorite of her books.
