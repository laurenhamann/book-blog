## Book Description

Nora Stephens’ life is books—she’s read them all—and she is not that type of heroine. Not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. The only people Nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister Libby.
This is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina for August when Libby begs her for a sisters’ trip away—with visions of a small-town transformation for Nora, who she’s convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. But instead of picnics in meadows or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, Nora keeps bumping into Charlie Lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. It would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they’ve met many times and it’s never been cute. If Nora knows she’s not an ideal heroine, Charlie knows he’s nobody’s hero, but as they are thrown together again and again—in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow—what they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they’ve written about themselves.


## My Thoughts
There is something so comforting about Emily Henry's books and this one is no different. I have been wanting to read this one for a while. I loved it. Nora is such an onion of a character. On the outside, she seems powerful yet cold, career driven. Her sister, Libby, is the complete opposite. A mother of three and a true dreamer. They end up taking a long vacation together and everything changes. The layers of Nora start to peel back and I can relate to her more and more throughout the read. This book is like a warm cup of cocoa on a cold night. You bundle up and read the entire book in one sitting. But actually, I packed for our Christmas trip while listening to the amazing narration. God, I love Julie Whelan. She is my favorite Narrator.
