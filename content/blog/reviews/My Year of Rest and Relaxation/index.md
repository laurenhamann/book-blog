## Book Description

Our narrator should be happy, shouldn’t she? She’s young, thin, pretty, a recent Columbia graduate, works an easy job at a hip art gallery and lives in an apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan paid for, like the rest of her needs, by her inheritance. But there is a dark and vacuous hole in her heart, and it isn’t just the loss of her parents, the way her Wall Street boyfriend treats her, or her sadomasochistic relationship with her best friend, Reva. It’s the year 2000 in a city aglitter with wealth and possibility; what could be so wrong?

## My Thoughts

I listened to this book because it was narrated by my favorite audiobook narrator Julia Whelan. The main character was so unsettling to me. She had almost no redeeming qualities. It was a dark reflection of the human condition.
I think I may have to listen again with a more abstract mindset.
