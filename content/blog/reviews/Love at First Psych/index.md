## Book Description

This Psych 312 assignment just might send me off the deep end. Determining whether love, at first sight, exists with Robbie Moravian as my project partner of all people?

He’s the sappiest man alive, so upbeat I could scream and root for happy endings at every turn. How does he not learn from experience considering our meet-cute last semester almost got us expelled?

But we both need to pass this course to graduate. So we’re interviewing five random couples about their meet-cutes and relationships and spending all this time together. Which is certainly...educational.

Because it turns out Robbie isn’t just the charming golden boy I thought I knew. There’s some actual depth beneath all those lame dad jokes and the ‘70s-inspired thrift wardrobe (even if he does look ridiculously great in a flared collar). Next thing I know he’s walking me back to my office on the regular and finishing all my sentences and protecting me from freak storms, and...

Wait. Could Robbie be right? Can happy endings come from unhappy beginnings? Is he about to change my entire worldview?
