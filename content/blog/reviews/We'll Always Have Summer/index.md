## Book Description

It's been two years since Conrad told Belly to go with Jeremiah. She and Jeremiah have been inseparable ever since, even attending the same collegeâ€”only, their relationship hasn't exactly been the happily ever after Belly had hoped it would be. And when Jeremiah makes the worst mistake a boy can make, Belly is forced to question what she thought was true love. Does she have a future with Jeremiah? Has she ever gotten over Conrad? It's time for Belly to decide, once and for all, who has her heart forever. 


## quotes
<blockquote>
    It took me a long time to figure it out, that I was the one who put my dad on that pedestal. I did that, not him. And then I despised him for not being perfect. For being Human - Conrad.

## My Thoughts
Jenny thinks she is grown in this book. But red flags are cropping up on every page. She is in love with Jeremiah. Amazing! But she is still in love with Conrad. The love triangle is about to break. The truth is coming out. Jenny isn't as sure as she pretends to be. This was a classic wrap-up book, but just because it isn't a new storyline. It is still lovely to care for new characters.
