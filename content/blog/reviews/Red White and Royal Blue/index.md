## Book Description

First Son Alex Claremont-Diaz is the closest thing to a prince on this side of the Atlantic. With his intrepid sister and the Veep’s genius granddaughter, they’re the White House Trio, a beautiful millennial marketing strategy for his mother, President Ellen Claremont. International socialite duties do have downsides—namely, when photos of a confrontation with his longtime nemesis Prince Henry at a royal wedding leak to the tabloids and threaten American/British relations. The plan for damage control: staging a fake friendship between the First Son and the Prince.

As President Claremont kicks off her reelection bid, Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret relationship with Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations. What is worth the sacrifice? How do you do all the good you can do? And, most importantly, how will history remember you?

## My Thoughts

I just finished this one. I haven't yet read a book about a man finding his sexuality and I thought it was written very well. This is my second book by this author and my least favorite. I found the story good but kind of boring. Every struggle was quickly fixed with little to no long-term consequences. The romance was cute but I didn't find myself feeling it in the bones. I love a good slow burn of a romance but this was different. I did find the main character's internal monologue of trying to find his sexual identity to be very compelling though. Glad I read it but wish it had grabbed my attention more.
