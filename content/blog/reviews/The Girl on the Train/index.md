## Book Description

EVERY DAY THE SAME
Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning and night. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She's even started to feel like she knows them. Jess and Jason, she calls them. Their life--as she sees it--is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.
UNTIL TODAY
And then she sees something shocking. It's only a minute until the train moves on, but it's enough. Now everything's changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel goes to the police. But is she really as unreliable as they say? Soon she is deeply entangled not only in the investigation but in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?


## My thoughts

I have a different relationship with this book. Unlike [A Walk to Remember](/reviews/A%20Walk%20to%20Remember/), I tried to watch this movie in the theaters and left early because I didn't understand what was going on at all. I have put off reading this book because of that. But I found the book to be very good. I liked the three different characters. Rachel was hard to listen to because she was struggling so much and being her own stumbling block most of the time. But I found her to be very strong in her own right. She knew something was off and she kept at it. Megan was difficult because she was so young and just got pushed along in her life. Everything she is doing is a reaction to her emotions. Her brother dies so she leaves and gets into a relationship with someone that isn't great for her. Anna is hard to listen to because she hates her husband's ex-wife so much that this even clouds her feelings towards her husband. She wants to put all the blame on Rachel but she starts to discover her husband is not the perfect man she thinks he is, she starts an internal struggle with what Tom had told her and what she has witnessed.
