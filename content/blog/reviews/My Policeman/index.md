## Book Description

From the moment Marion first lays eyes on Tom - her best friend's big brother, broad, blond, blue-eyed - she is smitten. And when he comes home from National Service to be a policeman, Marion, a newly qualified teacher, is determined to win him. Unable to acknowledge the signs that something is amiss, she plunges into marriage, sure that her love is enough for both of them...

But Tom has another life, another equally overpowering claim on his affections. Patrick, a curator at the Brighton Museum, is also besotted with his policeman and opens Tom's eyes to a world previously unknown to him. But in an age when those of 'minority status' was condemned by society and the law, it is safer for this policeman to marry his teacher. The two lovers must share him until one of them breaks and three lives are destroyed.

Unfolding through the dual narratives of Marion and Patrick, both writing about the man at the center of their lives, this beautifully-told, painful, tragic story is revealed. It is a tale of wasted years, misguided love and thwarted hope, of how at a time when the country was on the verge of change so much was still impossible.

## My Thoughts

I choose this book because I wanted to listen to the book before the movie came out. I have found I like the book more if I don't know the movie already. i.e [A Walk to Remember](../A%20Walk%20to%20Remember/index.md).
I liked the way this story was told from two people's perspectives. First, we hear the story of Marion and her deep affection for Tom. Then we hear from Patrick's point of view and this is where you get a peek into Tom a bit more. But Tom's true feelings are somewhat unknown throughout this story. I love the way this author didn't have to say everything and let the audience take away what they needed to.
