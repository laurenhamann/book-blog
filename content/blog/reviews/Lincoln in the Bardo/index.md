## Book Description

On February 22, 1862, two days after his death, Willie Lincoln was laid to rest in a marble crypt in a Georgetown cemetery. That very night, shattered by grief, Abraham Lincoln arrives at the cemetery under cover of darkness and visits the crypt, alone, to spend time with his sonâ€™s body. Set throughout that one night and populated by ghosts of the recently passed and the long dead.
